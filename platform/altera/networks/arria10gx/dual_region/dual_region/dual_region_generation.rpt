: dual_region.altclkctrl_0: Targeting device family: Arria 10.
: dual_region.altclkctrl_0: Global clock network allows a clock signal to reach all parts of the chip with the same amount of skew. Input port 'clkselect' can be used to switch between four clock inputs.
: dual_region.altclkctrl_0: The register mode of port 'ena' is unavailable while 'ena' port not added.
